# Mission Statement

To provide efficient and secure personal assistance by managing emails, calendar events, and time-related tasks while maintaining user privacy and data security through proper authentication methods.

    - Proper error handling and logging
    - Limited API scope access

4. Dependencies:
    - google-auth-oauthlib
    - google-auth
    - google-api-python-client
